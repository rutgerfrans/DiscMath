# Disrcete Mathematics
## Integers
- Whole numbers
- Symbol: Z

## Natural Numbers
- All integers greater then 1
- 0 is not a natural number (in this course atleast)
- Symbol: N

## Rational Numbers
- Any number that can be written as a/b where a and b are both integers and b is not equal to 0.
- Symbol: Q

## Real Numbers
- Basicly all numbers. 
- Every possible number.
- Symbol: R

## Divisibility
- m is divisible by k if there is an integer n such that m = k * n

## Odd numbers
- Any integer not divisble by 2
- n is odd if you can write it as n = 2m + 1

## Even numbers
- Any integer divisibl by 2
- n is even if you van write it as n = 2 * m
- 0 is an even number

## Perfect Square
- A product of an integer with itself

## Prime numbers
- Any natural number greather or equal to 2, which is oly divisible by itself and 1

## Statements
- Either true or false


## Proposition
### Negation(NOT)
- not
- the negation for propostion p is not p

### Conjunction(AND)
- and
- p AND q is true if both p and q are true.
- if one of them is false the statement is false

### Disjunction(OR)
- or
- p OR q is true whenever p or q is true.
- p OR q is only false when both p and q are false.

### Compound propositions
- p means "2 is an odd number" (FALSE)
- q means "37 is a prime number" (TRUE)
- r means "Maastricht is in Lumburg" (TRUE)

So:
- p and q or r  = TRUE
- (p and q) or r = TRUE
- p and (q or r) = FALSE

## Truth tables
- Truth tables allow us to systematially understand when a proposition is true or false

- [insert immages for truthtables for TRUE, FALSE, AND and OR]
### Tautology
- This happens when the whole truth table turns out TRUE

### Contradiction
-This happens when the whole truth table turns out FALSE

### Conditional statements
#### Conditional
- if p then q
- if --> q
- "p implies q"
- if p exists then q does so
- this statement is only false is p is true and q is false
- Use the drinking beer example

#### Biconditional
- p if and only if q
- p <--> q
- p iff q
- p only excists when q excists
- This statement is only TRUE when both are TRUE or FALSE
